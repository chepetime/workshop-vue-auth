# Workshop: Vue Auth

In this workshop we build a simple VueApp with Authentication and Route Handling

> Based on Egghead's [Vue Authentication And Route Handling Using Vue-router](https://scotch.io/tutorials/vue-authentication-and-route-handling-using-vue-router)

<br><br>

## Install

Install project pependencies with `npm`:

```sh
npm install
```

> You need to install Node.js, the latest version should do. You can also install `nvm` for handling your node versions.

Then, start the vue development server and API server with:

```sh
npm run start
```

This task is defined in the `package.json` file. Check it out if you want!
